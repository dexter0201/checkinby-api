/**
* Class: ProductPriceModel
* Description: ProductPriceModel provides methods to access all the PriceBook information of a product. A ProductPriceModel instance is retrieved by calling Product.getPriceModel() or Product.getPriceModel(ProductOptionModel) for a specified product. The latter method will return a model which also includes the additional option prices of an option product.
*
When the current price of a product is accessed in the storefront via its price model, a price lookup is performed. The high-level steps of this price lookup are:
* Get all price books applicable in the context of the current site, time, session, customer, source code.
* Identify all prices in the applicable price books and for a requested quantity.
* Calculate the best-price of all identified prices. The best-price is the lowest price.

In more detail:
Identify applicable price books:
* If any price books are explicitly registered in the session (see pipelet SetApplicablePriceBooks), use these price books and their direct parents for price lookup. Ignore all inactive price books, price books not valid at the current time, and price books with a currency other than the session currency.
Otherwise:
* If a valid source code is registered with the current session, get all price books assigned to the source code and their parent price books. Ignore all inactive price books, price books not valid at the current time, and price books with a currency other than the session currency.
* Get all price books assigned to site and their parent price books. Ignore all inactive price books, price books not valid at the current time, and price books with a currency other than the session currency.
Identify all prices:
* Get all price definitions for the product from all applicable price books. Ignore price definitions not valid at the current time.
* Convert any percentage price definition into a monetary amount. As the base price for this calculation, the minimum product price for the minimum order quantity of the product, including product options, is used.
* Compare all prices and identify the lowest (=best) price.
* Calculate best price for each defined price cut in the price table and return price table.
Variation Price Fallback:
* If no applicable price books for a variant is found, the price lookup gets the price books from the variant's master product.
* A price books is also not applicable of the price definition for the variant in the price book is not valid at the current time.

Typically, in order to to a standard price lookup, it is only necessary to call: "Product.getPriceModel(). getPrice(). However, Commerce Cloud also supports tiered prices, meaning that higher quantities receive a lower price. In this case, the merchant typically wants to display a table of price points on product details. Therefore, the ProductPriceModel provides the method "getPriceTable()" to retrieve a table of these prices.
If a merchant wants to know not only what the price of a given product is, but what price book the price was derived from, this class provides the method "getPriceInfo()". This class also provides methods to lookup product prices in specific price books by name and quantity. See "getPriceBookPrice(String)"
